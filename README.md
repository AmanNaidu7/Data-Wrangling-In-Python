# Data-Wrangling-In-Python
In this project I get data from 3 different sources (websites and APIs) and formats (tsv, csv and Twitter API data).

I analyse each data and perform a number of cleaning operations on them.

I also provide a few tidying operations on the dataset.

A summary of the wrangling process can be found in Wrangle Report.pdf

One the wrangling process is complete, I create a number of visualisations to show interesting finds.

I also attempt to fit the data using polynomial approximations.

A summary of this process can be found in Act Report.pdf

For a detailed look at the code used refer to wrangle_act.ipynb.
